A really crappy backup tool that you shouldn't use. Cause it's not tested. And will probably delete all your data.

Seriously, if you use it, you take all responsibilities for it. That said, it's not free. You can use it for your own purposes but
you may not redistribute it either for free or as part of another package, or any combination your twisted little mind conceives.
Just contact me and ask first. ;)

Note: this is a Windows 64-bit app only. It will not work on 32-bit, and I don't plan to port it. It's tested on 7 and 10. Binary is in the dist folder but buyer beware! Because a misconfiguration could cause you to lose files, I'm likely to be paranoid and not offer much support, instead saying "use something else". ;)
